California condors are a critically endangered bird species, but they are on the road to recovery.  Park units in California and across the southwest U.S. are protecting nesting habitat for these birds.  This map shows where the condors are known to roam and the parks involved in their recovery.  

The web map is built using [NPMap Builder](https://www.nps.gov/maps/tools/npmap-builder/), an NPS-specific tool that allows a map maker to load data, configure symbology and pop-ups, and enable web map specific tools.  Maps built using this tool are often times preferred by park web curators because they already come with the appropriate 'branding' and they play nice with the national park service's content management system.

You can see a live version of the map online [here](https://www.nps.gov/maps/full.html?mapId=3b6ff65f-9155-4a24-9cf7-6470440c44ca).
