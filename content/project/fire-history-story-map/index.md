Fire is a natural part of the Sierra Nevada landscape, including in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.  But fire has been managed by the National Park Service very differently over time.  This story map dives into the history of the fire management practices within the parks and the impacts of management decisions on the landscape.

The story map is built using the ESRI [Map Journal story map template](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/app-list/map-journal/).
