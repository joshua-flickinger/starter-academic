Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks monitor soundscapes to better understand biodiversity.  But the sounds aren't just used for science.  Many visitors to national parks rank the calming effects of natural soundscapes as one of their favorite aspects of visiting the parks.  So in order to share park sounds with a wider audience, I built an ESRI story map highlighting sounds of the parks.

The story map takes virtual visitors on the Middle Fork trail of Sequoia National Park, which spans a nearly 8,000 ft elevation gradient.  Hypothetically, any sound you can hear in the park can be heard from this trail.  Select sounds from each ecoregion along the trail give viewers an idea of the types of sounds they would encounter.

The story map is built using the ESRI [Cascade story map template](https://storymaps-classic.arcgis.com/en/app-list/cascade/).
