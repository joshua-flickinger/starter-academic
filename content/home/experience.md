  I built web maps, story maps, and paper maps for projects related to soundscapes, forest resilience, fire history, wildlife ranges, and recreation.

  details = """
  In addition to making maps, I managed geospatial and multimedia data using ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Desktop. I edited data for inclusion in an enterprise geodatabase. I published data to ArcGIS Online and the NPS data store. I built data collection tools and collected data using Collector and Survey123 for ArcGIS. I wrote R scripts to automatically process and generate data, edited multimedia (audio/video), and authored content for visitor centers, the park website, and interpretive programs. Through cross-training, I participated in field data collection and equipment maintenance for soundscape, air quality, and water quality projects.

  In the classroom I introduced lab concepts, answered questions about class concepts, oversaw independent lab work, and helped troubleshoot student errors. To prepare each lab, I met weekly with the class professor, evaluated and prepared spatial data for student use, edited lab instruction documents to relect changes generated by GIS software updates, produced a weekly slide show highlighting key skills utilized, and created example map outputs. In addition to hosting office hours for teacher-student interaction, I evaluated student work weekly. Feedback included quantitative grading of lab reports and qualitative comments on map outputs.

  description = """I lived in small fishing village, working with community fisherfolk to manage coastal resources including coral reefs, mangrove forests, and sea grass beds.
  """
  details = """
  My primary project was serving as a marine sanctuary management advisor. Duties included inventory and monitoring of coral reef and mangrove forests, organizational development, and drafting of plans and ordinances. Together with local government representatives, I also helped register thousands of community members as federally recognized fisherfolk - making them eligible for government services and assistance programs. For a secondary project in my community, I worked with the local Agriculture Officer and Nutritionist to establish a backyard gardening and vermiculture program targeting mothers with children at risk of malnutrition. We provided seeds, worms, and field guidance to dozens of program participants. With the local Agriculture Officer, I also helped host a farmer's field school in which local farmers shared challenges and success stories in their own rice paddies and coconut stands. I assisted other volunteers with their own resource management and education projects, including a summer camp focused on agriculture in the community. The camp targeted second year college students and taught sustainable farming practices. At a higher level, I worked with a provincial level tourism office, to collect GPS data for a provincial natural park.
