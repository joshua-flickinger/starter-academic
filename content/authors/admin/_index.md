Welcome to my personal webpage!  I'm a cartographer and data manager for Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.  My work is primarily focused on projects related to soundscapes and forests, including giant sequoias.  Prior to joining the National Park Service, I studied the effects of landuse change using GIS and remote-sensing as a student at the University of Michigan.
